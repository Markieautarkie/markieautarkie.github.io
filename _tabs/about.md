I'm Mark, a MSc. Computer Science graduate with a passion for **programming**, **technical doodads** and **video games**. Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 🐊

A big chunk of my time is spent tinkering away on projects. These range from spur-of-the-moment ideas to (over-engineered) game prototypes. While they often differ wildly from one another, all of them are born in a similar fashion: *with a drive fueled by curiosity and the eagerness to understand all kinds of stuff!* After all, learning new things is what makes coding so enjoyable for me, and what's more important than having fun?

For quite a while now, I've had this itch to create a personal space where I could yap to my heart's content about all kinds of topics which interest me, hence the existence of this blog! Expect rather informal ramblings about **game design**, **tech gadgets**, **programming concepts** and everything from random thoughts to longer, more informative posts.

I'm not one for adhering to tight schedules, so expect a pretty random update frequency. If you'd like to get notified whenever I post something, you could use a `RSS feed` and subscribe by clicking the button in the lower left corner.

Happy reading!
