Hi there, welcome to my brand new blog! In the upcoming months (years?) I'll hopefully be busy adding tons more content to this space. For now, this little introductory post will suffice to kickstart myself into writing at least *something*.

As to not completely copy/paste the [About](https://markieautarkie.github.io/about/) section, let me give you a quick tour instead! New posts will show up in [Home](https://markieautarkie.github.io/). You can further filter entries by browsing the [Categories](https://markieautarkie.github.io/categories/) and [Tags](https://markieautarkie.github.io/tags/) tabs. I'll try to keep things neatly organized in this manner.

If you'd like to contact me regarding a post, feel free to leave a comment below it! For other inquiries such as information about GitHub repositories, project-related stuff, my favorite pizza toppings or whether I'm able to land a sick kickflip or not (spoiler: **definitely not**), use any of the social buttons in the sidebar.

That's all for now, see ya around! ðŸ‘‹
